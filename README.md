# SatDog's Signal Snap

A fun, low-poly 3D game built with Next.js and React Three Fiber for a 7-day coding challenge!

## Game Concept

Help SatDog, a cute low-poly doge character, collect satellite components scattered around a colorful low-poly planet. Once you've gathered all 5 components (Antenna, Modem, Solar Panel, Battery, and Orbit Stabilizer), you'll assemble them in a drag-and-drop puzzle interface. Finally, launch your satellite into orbit and send a short burst message home!

## Features

- 🐕 Low-poly doge character with WASD/Arrow key controls and space to jump
- 🌍 Procedurally enhanced sphere planet with hills and craters
- 🛰️ Educational tooltips about Satellite IoT technology
- 🧩 Drag-and-drop satellite assembly interface
- 🚀 Animated satellite launch sequence

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15
- React 19
- React Three Fiber
- Three.js
- Tailwind CSS 4

## How to Play

1. Use WASD or arrow keys to move around
2. Press Space to jump
3. Explore the planet and collect all 5 satellite components
4. Assemble the satellite by dragging components to their correct spots
5. Launch your satellite and watch it orbit!
